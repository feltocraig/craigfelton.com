                              <p>On the "Platform 2.0" team, whose goal is to bring the company's back-end code up to date with modern cloud standards on Azure. 
                                 Experience writing C# code on IaaS, PaaS, and FaaS.
                                 Helped architect an event-driven serverless back-end for Kodak Picture Kiosks. 
                                 Wrote the core code for high-performance event producers and consumers. 
                                 Created new microservices to replace legacy systems.
                                 <br />
                                 Maintained a system for Disney theme parks that took images from rides and rendered them, tagged them with metadata, and made them accessible to users.
                                 Created a new API for image storage with the ability to handle 200,000 4MB images uploaded a day.

                                 Beyond coding and architecture design I was also heavy on dev-ops practices. 
                                 I helped create and maintain terraform scripts for our infrastructure as code. 
                                 Built and maintained CI/CD pipelines. 
                                 Created logging, error alerting, and SLO/SLA standards for our various microservices. 
                                 Presented the standards to the entire company's software engineers.

                              <p>Startup company where I wore lots of hats, but focused on scalability problems due to our fast growth.
                                 Our core software was an employee engagement web application written using C# on ASP.NET and hosted with Azure.
                                 Our multi-tenant platform supported companies with anywhere from 100-100,000 employess.
                                 Coordinated with a small agile team to implement a RESTful API used by our mobile app and third parties. 
                                 Communicated with vendors to build out SSO workflows, push notifications, and ETL pipelines.
                                 Worked on continual improvements to the sites architectural scalability to meet the constantly increasing traffic.
                                 Back-end development interfaced with both MongoDB and SQL data layers which also included an intermediate Redis cache layer.
                                 Front-end development included several javascript libraries; knockout.js being the primary view-model framework. 
                                 Introduced asynchronous programming standards, queued tasks, and globalization/DateTime localization to the company which helped scalability and usability.
                                 When Brand Integrity was acquired in 2018, I learned PHP 7 to fill the feature gap between the two platform's surveys and reporting.

                                 The business logic was written in Java and was packaged as microservices. 
                                 Data was contained in an enterprise sized PL/SQL database. 
                                 Front-end work was with Jquery, backbone.js, and APEX.
