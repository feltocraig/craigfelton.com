                                 A VC-backed startup offering a real-time cloud-based manufacturing ERP. 
                                 I contributed a lot to fixing scalability and availability issues as the company expanded.
                                 Developed a comprehensive, well-documented, and versioned public API. 
                                 Integrated our product with accounting software, CRMs, and various e-commerce platforms to enhance functionality.

                                 I played a pivotal role in the architectural transition from a single-tenant platform to a scalable multi-tenant SaaS solution. 
                                 I helped maintain and scale the infrastructure as we grew to hundreds of customers all while driving down cloud computing costs. 
                                 Dev-ops work included: CI/CD pipelines, monitoring/logging, alerting, test automation, and dynamically built infrastructure to support self-onboarding.
                                 <br />
                                 Additionally, I mentored junior engineers, imparting best practices and in-depth product knowledge.

                                 I helped create and maintain terraform scripts for our infrastructure as code. 
                                 Built and maintained CI/CD pipelines.

                              <p>Startup company where I wore lots of hats, but focused on scalability problems due to our fast growth.
                                 Our core software was an employee engagement web application written using C# on ASP.NET and hosted with Azure.
                                 Our multi-tenant platform supported companies with anywhere from 100-100,000 employess.
                                 Coordinated with a small agile team to implement a RESTful API used by our mobile app and third parties. 
                                 Communicated with vendors to build out SSO workflows, push notifications, and ETL pipelines.
                                 Worked on continual improvements to the sites architectural scalability to meet the constantly increasing traffic.
                                 Back-end development interfaced with both MongoDB and SQL data layers which also included an intermediate Redis cache layer.
                                 Front-end development included several javascript libraries; knockout.js being the primary view-model framework. 
                                 Introduced asynchronous programming standards, queued tasks, and globalization/DateTime localization to the company which helped scalability and usability.
                                 When Brand Integrity was acquired in 2018, I learned PHP 7 and Vue.js to fill the feature gap between the two platform's surveys and reporting.
